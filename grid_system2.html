                                <p>After the First Battle of Panipat in 1526,
                                    Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of
                                    Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a baoli (step
                                    well) in it. His successor, Humayun, was
                                    crowned in the fort in 1530. He was defeated
                                    at Bilgram in 1540 by Sher Shah Suri. </p>

                        <h2>Pratapgad Fort</h2>
                        <p>The Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
                            assigned Moropant Trimbak Pingle, his prime
                            minister, to undertake the construction of this
                            fort in order to defend the banks of the Nira
                            and the Koyna rivers, and to defend the Par
                            pass. It was completed in 1656.</p>
                        <p>The Battle of Pratapgad between Shivaji Maharaj
                            and Afzal Khan, a general of Adil Shahi dynasty,
                            was fought below the ramparts of this fort on 10
                            November 1659. This was the first major test of
                            the fledgling kingdom's army, and set the stage
                            of the establishment of the Maratha empire.[3]
                            Pratapgad Fort is a historical fort located in
                            Satara district of Maharashtra, near
                            Mahabaleshwar. It holds great significance in
                            the history of the Maratha Empire and is known
                            for its connection to Chhatrapati Shivaji
                            Maharaj. The fort, built in 1656, stands as a
                            symbol of valor and strategic brilliance.</p>
                        <p> Pratapgad continued to be involved in regional
                            politics.[until when?] Sakharam Bapu Bokil, a
                            well-known minister of Pune, was confined by his
                            rival Nana Phadnis in Pratapgad in 1778. He was
                            later moved from fort to fort until he died at
                            Raigad. In 1796, Nana Phadnis, while escaping from
                            the intrigues of Daulatrao Shinde and his minister
                            Baloba, assembled a strong garrison in Pratapgad
                            before heading to Mahad. In 1818, as part of the
                            Third Anglo-Maratha War, Pratapgad was surrendered
                            to the East India company.</p>
                        <p>Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation provides
                            regular bus service.[8] There are small shops,
                            restaurants and a handicrafts store. Many schools
                            also arrange educational trips to the fort. The fort
                            is also on many trekking routes of the area.

                            The fort has a large bronze equestrian statue of
                            Shivaji Maharaj. It was unveiled by Jawaharlal
                            Nehru, then Prime Minister of India on 30 November
                            1957.[10][11][12][13] The same year a road was
                            constructed by the Public Works Department from
                            Kumbhrosi village up to fort. A guest house and a
                            small park was built inside the fort in 1960.</p>
                        <p>Pratapgad fort is located at 15 km (9.3 mi) from
                            Poladpur and 23 km (14 mi) west of Mahabaleshwar, a
                            popular hill station of Maharashtra. The fort stands
                            1,080 metres (3,540 ft) above sea level and is built
                            on a spur which overlooks the road between the
                            villages of Par and Kinesvar.</p>
